<section><h2>The Merlion</h2>
<p style="font-family:Brush Script MT,Brush Script Std,cursive;">The Merlion is arguably the most iconic landmark in all of Singapore.  It is best described as a mythical creature that consists of a lion’s head with the body of a fish. A steady stream of water pours from its mouth. Although there are a few ‘official’ Merlion statues located around Singapore and abroad, in this article, we are describing the Merlion that is located in Marina Bay. The area around the Merlion is called ‘Merlion Park’.  This is one of the most frequently photographed landmarks in all of Singapore, and Asia for that matter.</p>
